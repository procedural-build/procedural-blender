Scripts, components and utilities for Blender 2.82+

## Installing the addon

Install the addon in Blender with the following steps

* Go to the latest *stable* [here](https://github.com/procedural-build/procedural-blender/releases/latest):
* Go to Blender -> Edit -> Preferences -> Addons -> Install... and select the .zip package


## Build distributable zip package

Build a zip package for distributing the Blender addon with:
```
./make.sh
```

This will make the zip file `./bin/procedural_compute.zip` which can be distributed and installed
into Blender as per the instructions above.

For development you can symbolically link the module source code directly into your
blender scripts folder with the command:
